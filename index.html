		<h1>Introducing Che de los Reyes-Ferrer</h1>
		<img src="./Che_photo.png" width="365px" height="450px">

		<p>My background is in investigative reporting. I established the first news research team of ABS-CBN News' Investigative & Research Group in the Philippines. Before that, I was part of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. I transitioned to media development work three years ago. I decided to participate in the MA in Engagement Journalism program at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York because I'm interested in continuing my work with community media, especially media startups, on finding innovative ways of producing public interest content and sustaining their operations to serve their communities. </p>

		<p> Here are some of my favorite journalistic pieces: </p>

		<ul>
		<li>
			<h2>War on Drugs: The Unheard Voices -- <a href=https://www.abs-cbn.com/war-on-drugs>ABS-CBN News</a></h2>

			<p class="description"> I was part of the team that produced this six-part investigative series. It was the first in-depth look into President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly drug war in the Philippines. It won two awards at the Society of Publishers in Asia's 2017 SOPA Awards for Best in Human Rights Reporting and Best in Investigative Reporting. It was also one of the first evidence of the state backing of the killings, and was among the foundations for the International Criminal Court case filed against the former President. Duterte was later arrested upon orders of the ICC and as of this writing, remains imprisoned at The Hague </p>

			<h2>Use only as directed -- <a href=https://www.propublica.org/article/tylenol-mcneil-fda-use-only-as-directed> Pro Publica </a> </h2>

			<p class="description"> This 2013 report left a lasting impact on me not only because of the solid research and writing, but because of the way it was executed. I was amazed by all the elements and ways that different parts of the story were executed, each part complementing and building on the others, forming a seamless and compelling full story. It has since become my inspiration and standard for multimedia investigative reports</p>
		</li>

		<li> 
			<h2>Indonesian Football Disaster: The Brutal Moments Towards Mass Death -- <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZYl4Jifzf4&rco=1> Narasi TV Indonesia </a> </h2>


		    <p class="description"> The amount of work that the small Narasi team put into 	this investigation, and the way that they gathered data for this piece was amazing. The team crowdsourced hundreds of footage from security cameras and videos taken on camera phones by the spectators of this football match where more than a hundred people were killed and more than 300 injured in what has become one of the deadliest sports stadium disasters. The Narasi team was able to weave all the material into a gripping video narrative. The story proved that the police directly fired tear gas into the crowd, causing a stampede. It led to an investigation of the police. </p>
